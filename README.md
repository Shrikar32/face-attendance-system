## Project Overview
This project is an automated, lightweight Facial Recognition Attendance System designed to replace manual roll calls. Built with Python, OpenCV, and DeepFace, the system captures student biometric data, generates facial embeddings, and performs real-time asynchronous recognition via a webcam feed.

## Features
*   **Real-Time Recognition:** Asynchronous multi-threading ensures the webcam runs smoothly at 30 FPS while AI inference runs in the background.
*   **Local Database:** Uses SQLite to store student data and attendance logs securely without external dependencies.
*   **Duplicate Prevention:** Database-level constraints automatically prevent marking attendance multiple times for the same student on the same day.
*   **CSV Export:** One-click export of attendance records for administrative use.
*   **Graphical Interface:** Clean and simple Tkinter GUI for seamless operation.

## Technology Stack
*   **Language:** Python 3.10+
*   **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (`cv2`)
*   **Facial Recognition:** DeepFace (RetinaFace Detector Backend)
*   **Database:** SQLite3
*   **GUI:** Tkinter
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas

## Requirements
*   Webcam (720p/1080p recommended)
*   Python 3.10 or higher
*   Requirements listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/face-attendance-system.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/face-attendance-system.git)
   cd face-attendance-system

   ----- HOW TO RUN -----
   python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py

System Workflow
1. Registration
Click [ REGISTER STUDENT ]. The system prompts for a PRN and Name. A webcam window opens with a bounding box guide. Pressing c captures the frame, saves the image to data/faces/, and logs the student details in the SQLite database.

2. Attendance
Click [ START ATTENDANCE ]. The system captures live video frames and dispatches them to a background thread. DeepFace calculates embeddings using the RetinaFace backend and verifies cosine similarity against the local face database. If a match is found, attendance is marked.

3. Export
Click [ EXPORT CSV ]. The system joins the relational tables, generates a formatted view, and exports attendance_export.csv to the data/ directory.

Database Schema
students: id (PK), roll_number (UNIQUE), name, image_path, created_at

attendance: id (PK), student_id (FK), date, time, status, UNIQUE(student_id, date)

Limitations
Accuracy is dependent on ambient classroom lighting.

The SQLite database is stored locally and requires network migration for campus-wide deployment.

Vulnerable to basic 2D photo spoofing (no depth-mapping or liveness detection implemented).

Future Scope
Anti-Spoofing: Integration of blink detection or depth-mapping to prevent photo spoofing.

Cloud Database: Migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL/Firebase for centralized synchronization.

Batch Processing: Upgrading the pipeline to recognize multiple faces simultaneously in a crowded frame.
